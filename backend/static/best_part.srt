1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,920
You don't know, babe

2
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,140
When you hold me

3
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:22,640
And kiss me slowly

4
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,640
It's the sweetest thing

5
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,640
And it don't change

6
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,800
If I had it my way

7
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,900
You would know that you are

8
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:42,260
You're the coffee that I need in the morning

9
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:45,480
You're my sunshine in the rain when it's pouring

10
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,860
Won't you give yourself to me?

11
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:50,080
Give it all

12
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,780
I just wanna see

13
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:55,400
I just wanna see

14
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:59,260
How beautiful you are

15
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:02,420
You know that I see it

16
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:05,580
I know you're a star

17
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:08,740
Where you go I'll follow

18
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:11,900
No matter how far

19
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:15,060
If life is a movie

20
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,220
You know you're the best part

21
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:24,220
You're the best part

22
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:25,220
You're the best part

23
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:28,380
You're the best part

24
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:32,380
You're the best part

25
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:35,540
You're the best part

26
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:36,640
You're the best part

27
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:42,640
You're the one that I desire

28
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,640
When we wake up

29
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,640
And then we make love

30
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,640
It makes me feel so nice

31
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,640
You're my water when I'm stuck in the desert

32
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,640
You're the talent all I take when my head hurts

33
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:09,640
You're the sunshine of my life

34
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:15,640
I just wanna see how beautiful you are

35
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:22,640
You know that I see it, I know you're a star

36
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:28,640
Where you go I'll follow, no matter how far

37
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:35,640
If life is a movie then you're the best part

38
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:41,640
Oh, you're the best part

39
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:47,640
Oh, best part

40
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:54,640
If you love me won't you say something

41
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,640
If you love me won't you say something

42
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,640
If you love me won't you

43
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,640
