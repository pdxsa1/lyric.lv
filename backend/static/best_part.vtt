00:00.000 --> 00:16.920
You don't know, babe

00:16.920 --> 00:20.140
When you hold me

00:20.140 --> 00:22.640
And kiss me slowly

00:22.640 --> 00:25.640
It's the sweetest thing

00:25.640 --> 00:29.640

00:29.640 --> 00:32.800
If I had it my way

00:32.800 --> 00:36.900

00:36.900 --> 00:42.260
You're the coffee that I need in the morning

00:42.260 --> 00:45.480
You're my sunshine in the rain when it's pouring

00:45.480 --> 00:47.860
Won't you give yourself to me?

00:48.220 --> 00:50.080

01:05.580 --> 01:08.740
Where you go I'll follow

01:08.740 --> 01:11.900
No matter how far

01:11.900 --> 01:15.060

01:36.640 --> 01:42.640
You're the one that I desire

01:42.640 --> 01:46.640
When we wake up

01:46.640 --> 01:50.640
And then we make love

01:50.640 --> 01:54.640
It makes me feel so nice

01:54.640 --> 01:58.640
You're my water when I'm stuck in the desert

01:58.640 --> 02:02.640
You're the talent all I take when my head hurts

02:02.640 --> 02:09.640
You're the sunshine of my life

02:09.640 --> 02:15.640
